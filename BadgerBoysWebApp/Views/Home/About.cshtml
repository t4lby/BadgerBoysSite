            <h2>Matt.</h2>
            <p>
                As the other front man Matt plays guitar and adds vocals to Alex’s lead. He says that ‘the best thing about being a Badger Boy is seeing the response of the crowd to the music we play’ and loves performing in as many places as possible!
                Matt also enjoys making a wide variety of music seem fresh, with only three badgers meaning the approach to songs must be unique. With mistakes and a lack of talent being his strengths, you’ll never hear the songs played in the same way again!!
