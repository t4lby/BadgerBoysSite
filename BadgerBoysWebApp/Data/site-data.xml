        “Well those of you who were here last evening got to enjoy The Threetles in a different light. They were the best we’d ever seen them and they entertained us from the moment they started to the moment they finished. They performed many classic covers with a few beatles songs thrown in.
        Not many bands get people up dancing straight away and keep them dancing all night. Well done to Matt, Tommie and Alex”
