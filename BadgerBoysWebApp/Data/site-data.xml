      <name>The White Horse Inn, Stourpaine</name>
      <content>Well those of you who were here last evening got to enjoy the boys in a different light. They were the best we’d ever seen them and they entertained us from the moment they started to the moment they finished. They performed many classic covers with a few beatles songs thrown in.
Not many bands get people up dancing straight away and keep them dancing all night. Well done to Matt, Tommie &amp; Alex”</content>

      <content>“I’ve been to every one of the boys gigs and they’ve never failed to impress me. I’d recommend The Threetles to anyone without hesitation. They know how to get a crowd up on the dance floor and their 3 way dynamic is just perfect.”</content>

      <name>John Frear, The Plough</name>
      <content>“The boys played at The Plough, Manston on 20th June, a venue renowned for live music in the local north Dorset area. I first saw them at our Beer Festival the year previous on an Open Mic day and felt they deserved a gig. How impressed I was, they turned The Plough into a very vibrant country pub with their blend of great music, superb singing and most of all their ability to punch above their weight. They are very young guys!!, but extremely talented and I thank them for bringing even the most diehard of regulars to the dance floor with their great sound.
I actually felt the rare need to thank them on our Pub Website and posted a short video taken at the event. Thank you to The boys and I look forward to your next gig in December, by which stage the word will have spread much more.”</content>

      <content>“These guys played in our pub in January, all three are very talented musicians and together they’re an amazing young Beatles Tribute Band. We thought they were a fab three back then but they returned recently to play at our ‘Steam Up’ event and completely rocked the joint – a great atmosphere with lots of dancing, toe tapping and singing along. Can’t wait to have them back!”</content>
